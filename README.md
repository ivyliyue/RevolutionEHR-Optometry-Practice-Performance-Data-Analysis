# RevolutionEHR-Optometry-Practice-Performance-Data-Analysis

The data used in this study comes from aggregated practice performance metrics provided by RevolutionEHR â€“ a cloud-based EHR that is specialized for optometry and ophthalmology. This project focuses on a critical event that occurs during patient care: the fulfillment, or capture, of an eyeglass prescription with the sale of a pair of eyeglasses to the patient. A key interest in the analysis is how the patient demographics and other clinical events affect the rate at which an eye care practice sells eyeglasses.

Several different analysis techniques in the exploration of the eye practice dataset were employed, and the efforts at understanding how the eyeglass capture rate is influenced. 1.	Correspondence analysis was utilized to explore the relationship between the patient age groups with the total payment received by eye care practices. 2.	Cluster analysis was employed to explore the clinical events and the patient demographics. 3.	Principal component analysis is applied to look for any underlying relationships in the dataset. 

Insight from these analyses have been combined to build a predictive model of the eyeglass capture rate using regression model building.
